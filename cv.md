### **About me**

A simple guy who wants to learn front-end development. Now in this area I have very little practical experience that I could talk about.
But I study every day to gain this experience and become a good specialist.

Since I canâ€™t talk about my hard skills, I will try to tell about myself from the side of soft skills.

* **Organized** - i always prioritize my tasks and solve them efficiently and in a timely manner.
* **Team player** - i always become a patriot of my work and my team, I appreciate openness and communication in the team.
* **Easily adaptable** - it doesn't take long for me to understand how something works.I easily perceive new information, loyally accept my mistakes and correct them.

If you are on the same team with me, you can always rely on me and be sure that I will complete all my tasks.

"Does my number look big in this?"

*A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. Code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. This may be True and False.*
```
function narcissistic(value) {
  let result = 0;
  value = value.toString();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < value.length; ++i) {
    result += Math.pow(value[i], value.length);
  }

  return (result == +value) ? true : false;
}
