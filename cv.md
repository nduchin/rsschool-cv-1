A simple guy who wants to learn front-end development and is ready to devote himself to learning.
I always try to find not just a solution to the problem, but to fully understand how it all works.

### **Code Examples**

CodeWars KATA **6ky** "Does my number look big in this?"
*A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. Code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false') depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number in base 10. This may be True and False.*
```
function narcissistic(value) {
  let result = 0;
  value = value.toString();
  
  for (let i = 0; i < value.length; ++i) {
    result += Math.pow(value[i], value.length);
  }

  return (result == +value) ? true : false;
}
```
